# Mappi

Mappi is an interactive map where users can save different locations (e.g. favorite restaurants) under personal folders, and can optionally add notes for each location. Friends can then share these folders with other users of the app, so that you can see your friends’ different location sets. Our app will also have checklist functionality so that users can check off places they’ve been to on their friends’ lists. One target audience for this app is incoming WashU freshmen, so that they can see some St. Louis favorites to get to know the city.
